# Task 1 & 2: AI Chat Demo 

# Overview
This project covers Task 1 and Task 2 from the AI-Intern tasks.
The main goal was to understand how an AI chat system works by taking user input, processing it, and then returning an AI-generated response.

I initially planned to connect this project with the OpenAI API and also build a simple GUI so it could work similar to ChatGPT. However, due to API quota limitations, the current version uses a simulated (fake) AI logic while keeping the same structure and workflow used in real AI APIs.

## Files in This Repository

### ai_chat.py
This is the main Python script.  
It demonstrates A chat-like interaction in the terminal,  Temperature experimentation and Text file summarization

### sample.txt
A sample text file used to demonstrate how AI can summarize content.

## Chat Demo (User Interaction)
The program runs in the terminal, the user type messages the system replies with a simulated AI response typing `exit` ends the chat

This demonstrates the basic AI workflow:

**User Input → AI Processing → AI Output**

## Temperature Experiment

The temperature parameter controls how creative the AI response is.
